# [See App](http://saqme.me/redberry/#/)

### Web app for covid questions.  <br>
For the routing I used react router. \
State management is handled with redux, it isn't big project, but I wanted to learn redux :)) \
Forms and error handling with react-hook-form. \
Styling - plain css, app is responsive.
